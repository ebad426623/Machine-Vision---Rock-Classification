# Rock Classification Using OpenCV Object Detection

## 1 Project Overview

This project involves classifying three different classes of rocks using OpenCV object detection. The key steps in the project include:

- Capturing a dataset using a Hikrobot camera and lighting.
- Converting images to the HSV feature space.
- Storing the extracted features in a CSV file.
- Training a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model on the collected data.
- Performing real-time rock classification using live video feeds.

The model successfully classified most of the rocks with high accuracy.
