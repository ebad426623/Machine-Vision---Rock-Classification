# Rock Classification Using OpenCV Object Detection

## 1 Project Overview

This project involves classifying three different classes of rocks using OpenCV object detection. The key steps in the project include:

- Capturing a dataset using a Hikrobot camera and lighting.
- Converting images to the HSV feature space.
- Storing the extracted features in a CSV file.
- Training a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model on the collected data.
- Performing real-time rock classification using live video feeds.

The model successfully classified most of the rocks with high accuracy.

## 5 Code Documentation

In [OpenCv.py](./Python%20Scripts/Rocks%20Classification/OpenCv.py), I collected the dataset from the camera and saved it into [rock_data.csv](./Python%20Scripts/Rocks%20Classification/rock_data.csv). The stored features were the mean values of the HSV color space.

In [PredictRocks.py](./Python%20Scripts/Rocks%20Classification/PredictRocks.py), I used the previously collected data to train a KNN model, enabling real-time rock classification.

In [ClassificationUsingHistogram.py](./Python%20Scripts/Rocks%20Classification%20using%20Histogram/ClassificationUsingHistogram.py), I classified rocks using KNN by first converting the HSV color space into a histogram. I then used the histogram features to train the KNN model and performed real-time predictions. This method proved to be more accurate than using just the mean HSV values as features.

In [BackgroundSubtraction.py](/Python%20Scripts/Background%20Subtraction/BackgroundSubtraction.py), I use background subtraction, object detection, and classification to identify and categorize objects in a scene. First, I capture the background when no objects are present and store it as a reference image. During operation, I process each new frame by subtracting the background to isolate foreground objects, applying thresholding and morphological operations to refine the mask. I then use connected component analysis to detect individual objects, filtering out those below a minimum area threshold. To classify the detected objects, I extract their regions, convert them to the HSV color space, and compute color histograms as features. These features are normalized and passed to a pre-trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for classification. By integrating these techniques, I efficiently detect and classify objects based on color features while minimizing noise.
